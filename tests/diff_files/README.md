These are files that are used to test the internal diffing function of pytest-
workflow.

A link to the license is present because it contains ample text to check and
we do not need to distribute another file in the git repo.

This README can be compared to the other READMEs in tests/*/README.md to
test comparison of similar but non-identical files.
